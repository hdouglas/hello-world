Use this to test and play around

This readme file doesn't really do much. I'd say it's like a rock, but it is liable to change. Kind of like a screensaver on an LCD screen. Beautiful, but ultimately pointless.

Phew! Almost just downloaded another version of Sublime text.

What happens if I make changes after I've deleted the branch I was working in before?
